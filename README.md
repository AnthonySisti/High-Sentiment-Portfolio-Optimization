# High-Sentiment-Portfolio-Optimization
Final Project for UConn's Financial Programming and Modeling Master's Course

# Goal
The purpose of this assignment was to utilize financial, mathematical and programming knowledge that was obtained throughout the year to create your own stock trading strategy. My group traded stocks that were being talked about positively in online blogs, and optimized the risk and return trade off under different conditions.
